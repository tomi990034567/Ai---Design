                <p>One significant challenge I encountered was properly refining AI-generated outputs to achieve my desired artistic goals and concepts. With many of the tools, it took numerous iterations providing feedback to the models to start producing results that were truly reflective of my intentions. Another difficulty was integrating AI outputs together cohesively, such as splicing generated audio clips or video segments into a unified whole. The technical aspects of working with different file formats presented obstacles. Pushing the boundaries of what's possible also meant grappling with limitations in the current technology. For example, some concepts I envisioned were simply beyond the capabilities of the tools at this point. I found that Blender was the most difficult software to use and took the most time to learn for my 3D and AI explorations. The technical 3D modeling skills required presented a steep learning curve. Overall, the most challenging part of the process was learning to thoughtfully direct such powerful creative assistants while maintaining control over the final products. Moving forward, I aim to develop even stronger design skills to better harness the potential of AI.</p>
