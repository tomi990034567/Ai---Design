                <p>Over the past term, I have engaged in a variety of creative explorations using different AI tools and techniques. My overarching goal was to experiment with generating original works across multiple mediums while pushing the boundaries of what is possible with current AI technology.  One of my most successful outcomes came from my work with 3D and AI using Blender and Stable Diffusion. I set out to develop a surrealist 3D scene populated with AI-generated objects and characters. After many iterations tweaking prompts and 3D modeling, I was able to realize a dreamlike environment that blended hyper-realistic textures with abstract, otherworldly forms. This allowed me to achieve my goal of merging different styles in a 3D space.</p>  
                <p>In the NERFs workshop using Lumi.ai, I focused on generating a portrait of my city's symbolic landmark in Sweden. After many rounds of feedback, I created a portrait imbued with subtle meanings around themes of identity and cultural heritage.</p>  
                <p>When experimenting with AudioLDM for audio generation, I aimed to generate actual Christmas tracks as well as ambient background music and soundscape effects. I focused on crafting holiday songs that captured the spirit of the season, and ambient tracks meant to set specific moods or atmospheres. </p> 
                <p>For video generation using Runway and PikaLabs, I focused on telling short, surreal stories through AI-assisted filmmaking. One video I am proud of follows a character through a dreamlike day that blends reality with generated elements. Splicing together AI outputs allowed me to push the boundaries of storytelling in new ways.</p> 
                <p>Finally, in designing design methods with ChatGPT, I sought to develop a framework for integrating AI into the creative process in an ethical, considerate manner.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>The outcomes of these discussions helped expand my thinking around responsible and thoughtful uses of AI moving forward.  In conclusion, this practical coursework allowed me to make new discoveries at the intersections of art, technology, and human expression. I am eager to build upon these explorations in future creative endeavors.</p>
