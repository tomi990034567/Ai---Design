                <p>Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. Artists can use Blender to design 3D models and scenes, which can then be rendered into 2D images or animated using cycles or other render engines. 
                Stable Diffusion is an AI model created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It can generate images and text based on prompts provided by the user. Stability AI has created plugins that integrate Stable Diffusion directly into Blender. This allows 3D artists to leverage the powerful generative capabilities of Stable Diffusion to assist in their work. For example, an artist can use a 3D scene created in Blender as part of the prompt to Stable Diffusion, and it will incorporate visual elements from the scene into the generated image. This effectively allows Stable Diffusion to function as a photorealistic rendering engine for Blender scenes. It provides 3D artists a new tool for quickly exploring design ideas and concepts through AI-generated images that combine both text and 3D scene elements. The integration of Stable Diffusion and Blender represents an exciting new application of generative AI for 3D content creation.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>I have used Blender along with Stable Diffusion and DeepBump to concept and render 3D scenes for this project on generative design. Experimenting with incorporating AI image generation into my Blender workflow helped me rapidly explore different design ideas. Leveraging the capabilities of Stable Diffusion through a Blender plugin allowed me to generate photorealistic images from my 3D scenes, which I included in the final presentation for my assignment.</p>
