                <p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a novel view synthesis technique that uses neural networks to represent scenes as continuous volumetric density functions. NeRFs allow for novel views of a scene to be rendered via volumetric rendering.
                Luma AI is a company that is making NeRFs more accessible to consumers. They have developed apps and plugins that allow users to easily create NeRF models using just their smartphone. Luma AI's app allows iPhone users to scan an environment and generate a NeRF model that can be viewed in augmented reality on the phone.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p> I have used the Luma AI mobile app on my iPhone to scan the central area of Ume√• in Sweden and generate a NeRF model of one of the symbols of the city, which I have included in my presentation for this assignment. The app made it quite simple to 3D scan an environment using just my phone and create an interactive NERF that shows the detail and scale of the location:</p>

                <p>This video was created on a German christmas market in Duisburg. I found it difficult to film the top of the statue, because there was no elevation to scan the top of it. It still worked out quite good.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Aim of the Exploration: The primary creative goal was to easily capture a real-world environment through 3D scanning on a mobile device and generate an interactive NeRF model to showcase the scale and detail of the location.
                Challenges Faced: One challenge was getting clear and comprehensive scans of the environment using just a smartphone camera without specialized scanning hardware. Environmental factors like lighting, shadows and obstructions had to be considered.
                Future Directions: Going forward, it would be interesting to see NeRF capabilities expanded on mobile through AR/VR applications. More advanced scanning techniques and post-processing could improve model quality. Integrating NeRFs with other real-time rendering techniques may enable new types of spatially aware mobile experiences. As hardware improves, NeRFs on mobile have strong potential for a wide range of applications.</p>
