                <p>Runway is an AI tool that allows users to generate videos using text prompts. It has models that can synthesize videos of people, objects and scenes. The videos look realistic but are computer generated. Runway gives creators a way to rapidly prototype and concept video ideas without filming. PikaLabs builds AI tools for video generation and editing. Their flagship app is called Pikazone which allows users to generate videos of people dancing, talking or performing actions. It works by typing prompts like "A man dancing salsa" or uploading a reference image for the subject. The videos are limited but very realistic. Both Runway and Pikazone make video generation more accessible. Creators can generate preliminary video clips and animations through simple prompts to test out narrative or visual ideas. The AI handles the technical aspects of synthesizing realistic video frames. This allows video content to be explored and iterated on much faster compared to traditional filming and editing workflows. It also opens up video creation to those without technical video skills. Overall, these tools have the potential to transform how video content is designed and produced.</p>

                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>This video is for an assignment in my Text to Video course. 
                I began by creating a storyline with two to five scenes using the AI assistant Forefront. In total three different scenarios. This helped me plan out the key elements for each short clip.
                Once I had the storyline, I used the AI tool Runway to generate videos based on prompts describing the scenes. Runway allowed me to refine the prompts until I got results that matched what I envisioned. 
                After that, I created added sound effects with AudioLDM to bring each scene to life. I created sound clips that fit the mood and action happening in each video part.
                Finally, I edited everything together in Premiere Pro. I storyboarded the clips, added transitions, and refined the timing. The end result was a short 3-part video telling the story from the initial text prompts.</p>

                 <p>A few months ago, my friend Dominik asked me for help creating a new promotional video for his company. He wanted something that would showcase the process automation services they provide to clients.
                Since their work involves streamlining workflows and systems, I thought an AI-generated video would be fitting. I decided to use Lumen5, as it allows users to generate videos simply by writing descriptive text.
                First, I sat down with him to understand his business and target audience better. We discussed the types of industries they typically work with, as well as the benefits clients gain from process automation solutions. This helped me craft the narrative and key messaging.
                In Lumen5, I began by writing a script that introduced the company and outlined the three main parts of their service - analyzing processes, implementing automation tools, and ongoing support. For each section, I included details on real-world examples and outcomes.
                The AI software analyzed my input and generated storyboard images to illustrate the text. I was able to refine the prompts until the visuals clearly portrayed what I described.
                Once satisfied with the storyboard, Lumen5 compiled the stills into a video with basic transitions. I then edited the final product in Premiere - adding intro/outro graphics, background music, and voiceover.
                The finalized video turned out great. </p>
